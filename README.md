#  Storms and Port Congestion

Code to analyze storm and port congestion data, seeking to assess the impact that storms have on logistics delays and make predictions about the impact of future storms on port congestion.

## Description

This code is in its early stages. First, I will be working on the code to download the data and store it into SQL databases. Then, I will work on the code to extract the data using SQL scripts in python. 
After that, I will work on the main analysis which is the impact that past storms have had on port congestion and delays. Last, I will use the data to train a machine learning model that will use storm tracking data to make predictions about future port congestion issues.
